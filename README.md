- Technologies used

## Live Demo (if available)

[Live Demo Link](https://livedemo.com)


## Getting Started

**This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.**

## Project requirements
- Create a new empty repo.
- Copy your code from the project that you completed during the Admissions Trial: - If you do not have the code from the Admissions Trial  ask someone from your Standup Team to share their code with you. In that case, remember to add an attribution note and acknowledgment in your README file.
- Create a new branch for your copied code.
- Open a pull request.
- Play the role of the Code Reviewer:
- Follow the list from the article "How to give a code review?".
- Check if you have used semantic HTML tags.
- Check if you applied HTML & CSS best practices.
- Add as many comments as possible in the given time and finish your review. Remember to add a minimum of 2 comments you will definitely find something that could have been done better!
- Copy a link to the pull request and ask for a code review in your Student Dashboard as usual. (The only difference will be that the Code Reviewer won't check your code but the review you performed - isn't it a code review inception? ;))


To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.
